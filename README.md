TRB Blog
================

Application using [TRB 2](http://trailblazer.to/gems/operation/2.0/release_notes.html), Formular and Dry-Validation

Used also to test the new functionality of [tyrant](https://github.com/apotonick/tyrant) (Reset and Forgot password)

(Ones this is completed) This may be used as starting point of any TRB project, just need to change the Post model with whatever the project needs.
In thi was you have all the basic functionality of `User` (CRUD), `Session` (Sing In, Sign Out), `Flash Messagges`, `User Notification`....

###TO DO###
- Notifications are set on `:test` so need to change this if you want a real email
- Better look for the emails (using Cell maybe)
- Review CSS overall (I'm really bad with CSS)
